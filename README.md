# KlangValley-House-Price-Prediction

Housing affordability is an increasing problem in Malaysia especially in Klang Valley which covers Kuala Lumpur and Selangor.
The house developers are not building more affordable houses and the wages of Malaysian remains almost stagnant compared to 10 years ago causing a mismatch in demand and supply.
Hence, we would like to investigate how house price differ by areas and other factors such as leasehold/freehold, facilities and etc to determine which are the most important factors in determining house price.
Also, with a simple calculation of Debt Servicing Ratio (DSR), we can recommend area and house type which is affordable.

Teaser: We will elaborate more about the problem statement as well as the project objectives when we reach milestone 3 and 4 as they are more closely related with our solutions.

This is the video of our first milestone which is web scraping.
The video describes the challenges that we faced as well as the Python code used in scraping properties data from the websites.
