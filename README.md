# KlangValley-House-Price-Prediction
The Malaysia government has classified Malaysian into 3 groups based on their monthly household income with T20 refer to the top 20% of the most affluent household group in Malaysia, M40 the middle 40% and B40 the bottom 40%.
Department of Statistics Malaysia has published the median monthly household income of each demarcation. We see that the B40 household has RM 3000 only as median income and hence raises question on whether these households are able to own a house in the Klang Valley.
Moreover, Klang Valley has the most number of M40 household but a RM 5000 household income might also be considered as urban poor as the house price and living expenses in Klang Valley are more expensive.
Therefore, data is scraped from a property listings website in order to address the concerns of house affodability for B40 and M40 groups.

The objective of the project is to
1. Find out whether we have sufficient affordable houses for B40 and M40 groups in Malaysia Klang Valley.
2. Predict house price based on available attributes
3. Recommend possible area and housetype combination to the users with their salary

Below are all the videos directory explaining our progress in each stage.

This is the video of our Milestone 1 which is web scraping.
The video describes the challenges that we faced as well as the Python code used in scraping properties data from the websites.

Next, this is the Milestone 2 video which talks about the challenges and things to take note of when installing Hadoop and Hive in Windows 10. The command prompt used to store the database into hive is uploaded as a text file.

In Milestone 3, data retrieval from Hive is required.

In Milestone 4, we obtain insights from the dataset.
The video in the link  below will present on the insights and the process in addressing our objectives.

Some error in my presentation, the affordable house price should be 300k instead of 30k.
